# Quiz-Application Project

The project required use of HTML, CSS, bootstrap and Javascript to make a web application that allows users to take a quiz.
The application required extensive use of object oriented programming concepts and as expected it was a herculean task to complete becuase of its comlicated nature. I have developed this project based on basic knowledge of Javascript. If paid close attention, the data storage function is not being excuted in the storage.js file at the moment due to technical errors and hence the application does not offer a data storage facility. Additionally, the timer is working independently from the quiz itself. If you begin the quiz without clicking the start button, the timer will remain untriggered. With proper research and assistance the application will be made fully functional and will be up running at full capacity.

This quiz application consists of five  questions that are related to JavaScript. Each question has four options to choose from and the user must choose an option before moving forward to the next question. At the end of the quiz, the application will give the use how my questions are answered correctly.
